# Customer Segmentation

The dataset is from a Korean online programming course: (https://www.codeit.kr/topics/project-data-analysis-rfm).
This course helped me walk through customer segmentation by conducting RFM Analysis.
Additionally, I ran a clustering analysis to conduct my own customer segmentation analysis.

I assume the role of a data analyst for a retailer and am tasked with developing marketing strategies to target different segments of customers by conducting an RFM analysis on a customer dataset.
